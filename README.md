I implemented a shopping cart page which is structured by Cart.html and desing By Cart.css and functionality bt Cart.js. By using Javascript i fetch the data from API and display on the page with item name, item price, item image, item quantity etc. If user want to remove the item from the cart then it will pop-up a model for confirmation. Added a loader when data will be loaded from API the spinner will be visible. When the quantity will be increase or decrease the total price will be reflected. I added the CHECKOUT button , if user want to checkout it will show a confirmation message.
